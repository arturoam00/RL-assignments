# DPRL Assignment 1

## Get started

Download the repo and cd to it. Install the required dependencies doing (in an activated virtual environment):
```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the main file 
```bash
$ ./main.py
```
This will generate all the plots that appear on the report and store them in a folder named `imgs`,
in the same directory. 
It will also print the maximum total expected rewards for both problmem one and two.
